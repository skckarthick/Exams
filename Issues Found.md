Finally, in the dark mode, the selected tab has black letters and unselected tabs also have black letters, which makes invisible in the dark mode. can i have white letters for unselected tabs?
Also, can we have the symbol in browser tab favicon. the symbol in home page headline is fine.
Wherever the page such as subject, practice and quiz/mock, when u click the practice or quiz mode, in the particular page, the questions sections should be prominently shows in front screen and upon completion and close only it shoudl return to the concerned page source? is it possible. because, so many tabs and links are the in each mode and questions answer sections are dumped somewhere in the middle page. Only practice mode question part should be visible in that time.
